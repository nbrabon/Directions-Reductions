This was from code wars site and had the following instuctions:
Once upon a time, on a way through the old wild mountainous west,…

… a man was given directions to go from one point to another. The directions were "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST". Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too.

Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction right away is a needless effort. Since this is the wild west, with dreadfull weather and not much water, it's important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!

I worked on this problem for a few hours to show my coding style for WWT.
